For the complete analysis, use the script in this order:

**script 1:** Extraction of the proteomes of interest from GISAID's fasta file: allprot(release).fasta

**script 2:** Concatenation of sequences in multifasta file and listing of headers and EPI codes in own files

**script 3:** Selection of quality sequences

**script 4:** Filtering quality sequences

**script 5:** SWeeP projection of sequences in vectors

**script 6:** Consensus Clustering step

**Sample_GISAID_Release0609.fasta** Sample of GISAID data from release 609 to run a pipeline test
